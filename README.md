# mistery-organism-simulator
## Context:  
 
    Youâ€™re part of a research team that has found a new mysterious organism
    at the bottom of the ocean near hydrothermal vents. Your team names the organism, 
    Pila aequor (P. aequor), and finds that it is only comprised of 15 DNA bases. 
    The small DNA samples and frequency at which it mutates due to the hydrothermal
    vents make P. aequor an interesting specimen to study. However, P. aequor cannot
    survive above sea level and locating P. aequor in the deep sea is difficult and expensive. 
    Your job is to create objects that simulate the DNA of P. aequor for your research team to study.
---    

    The program creates objects that simulate organisms with random DNA bases, 
    with the ability to mutate, create a complementary strand, compare its DNA 
    with another organism, evaluate its likeliness to survive based on its DNA 
    base, create samples with specified rules and evaluate which are the most 
    related instances of organisms in the sample.
